# Contributing

## Open Development

All work happens directly on GitHub. Both team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Security

If you find a security vulnerability please avoid opening an issue and instead contact a team member directly at <https://github.com/orgs/merit-network/people>.

## Submitting Changes

Please [open a pull request](https://github.com/merit-network/merit-network.github.io/compare) and we'll review your changes.
